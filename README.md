# DNA-cli
A DNA sequence toolkit written in python.

This is a set of functions that were originally written to solve ROSALIND coding problems in my free time.
I decided to compile all of these into one repository and I plan on making this a terminal app... one day.

This is still far from complete as I have to implement
a GUI and overall implement it into the terminal.
*I am however- too lazy
for that right now. Oops.*
