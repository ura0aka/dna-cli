# DNA-cli
A DNA sequence toolkit written in python.

This is a set of functions that were originally written to solve ROSALIND
coding problems. This is still far from complete as I have to implement
a GUI and overall implement it into the terminal. *I am however, too lazy
for that right now. Oops.*
